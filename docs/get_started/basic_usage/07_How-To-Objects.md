# How to use the Object API / ObjectServiceClient

## Introduction

Objects are the primary resource to actually hold the data you upload. 

In any case, Objects need at least a Project that acts as the root of their hierarchy. However, this project does not have to be the direct parent, but objects can also be attached below a collection or a dataset by specifying the latter as the parent during creation.

If you don't know how to create other hierarchical resources you should read the previous chapters on how to use the [**Project API**](04_How-To-Project.md), [**Collection API**](05_How-To-Collections.md) and/or [**Dataset API**](06_How-To-Datasets.md).


## Initialize Object

The first step is to initialize an Object.
This creates an Object in the AOS with a status of _Initializing_ which marks it as a _Staging Object_.
As long as an Object is in the staging area data can be uploaded to it.

??? Tip "Hash validation"

    If you provide a SHA256 and/or MD5 hash with the initializing of an Object it will be automatically validated by 
    the DataProxy after the data upload has been finished. This ensures that the upload was successful and complete. 

??? Abstract "Required permissions"

    This request requires at least APPEND permission on the parent resource in which the Object is to be created.

    response = client.object_client.CreateObject(request=request)

    # Do something with the response
    print(f'{response}')
    ```


## Upload data to a Staging Object

After initializing an Object you can request an upload url with the object id you received from the initialization.
Data then can be uploaded through the received url to the AOS data proxy.

If the data associated with the Object is greater than 5 Gigabytes you have to request a _multipart_ upload and chunk your data in parts which are at most 5 Gigabytes in size.
You also have to request an upload url for each part individually.

!!! Tip "S3 Presigned download URL"

    You can also generate presigned URLs on your own for the specific AOS DataPoxy you want to upload the Object data to.

??? Abstract "Required permissions"

    Requesting an upload URL needs at least APPEND permissions on the Object's Collection or the Project under which the Collection is registered.

### Single part upload

!!! Info

    **Single part upload automatically starts the finishing process of the respective Object once the upload has been finished to make it available.**

    response = client.object_client.GetUploadURL(request=request)

    # Do something with the response

    upload_url = response.url

    # Upload local file to the generated upload URL
    file_path = "/path/to/local/file"
    headers = {'Content-type': 'application/octet-stream'}
    upload_response = requests.put(upload_url, data=open(file_path, 'rb'), headers=headers)

    # Do something with the response
    print(f'{upload_response}')
    ```


### Multipart upload

For each uploaded part of the multipart upload you will receive a so called `ETag` in the response header which has to be saved with the correlating part number for the Object finishing.

**Numbers of upload parts start with 1, not 0.**

**Multipart uploads have to be [finished manually](#finish-object) as the DataProxy cannot know or guess how many parts will be uploaded in total.**

!!! Tip

    Upload of parts from multipart upload can be uploaded parallel.

!!! Warning

    **If the data is stored in an S3 endpoint individual parts of multipart upload have to be at least 5MiB in size (5242880 bytes) or the Object finishing will fail. This limitation is part of the official S3 multipart upload specification.**

## Finish Object

Finishing the Object transfers it from the staging area into production i.e. makes it available.
From this moment the Object is generally available for other functions than [Get Object](#get-object).
On success the response will contain the finished Object analog to the response content of a .

??? Tip "When to finish an Object?"

    Object finishing is only needed in the following cases:

    * Object created/updated without upload
    * Object created/updated with multipart upload

    Single part upload automatically starts the finishing process of the associated Object once the data upload has been finished and validated.

??? Tip "Object hashes"

    SHA256 and MD5 hash sums are always calculated automatically for the content of the object and added to the object, so they do not have to be explicitly specified when finishing. Currently AOS only supports SHA256 and MD5 but the list can be extended if the demand arises.

    So, in the future further hashes of the object can be specified, which are also added to the object. However, these hashes are not validated against the content of the object.    

??? Abstract "Required permissions"

    This request requires at least APPEND permission on the parent resource in which the Object is to be created.

## Get Object(s)

Fetch information on finished or staging Objects via their unique id.

You can also fetch information on multiple Objects with a single request. In this case the permission requeirements apply to each Object individually.

??? Abstract "Required permissions"

    This request requires at least READ permissions on the Object or one of its parent resources.

## Download Object data

To download the data associated with an Object you have to request a download url. 

!!! Tip "S3 Presigned download URL"

    You can also generate presigned URLs on your own for the specific AOS DataPoxy you want to download the Object data from.

    This request requires at least READ permissions on the Object or one of its parent resources.

                f.write(chunk)
    ```


## Update Object

Objects can still be updated after finishing. 
Depending on the fields to be updated a new revision of the Object gets created. 
You can check if the returned Object is a new revision through the response paramater `new_revision`.

Operations which are updated "in-place":

* Description modification
* Key-value adding
* Dataclass relaxing 
* Parent modification
* `AllRightsReserved` license update 

Operations which always trigger the creation of a new revision:

* `force_revision == true` in the request
* Name update
* Key-value removal
* Object hashes modification
* License update with the exception of `AllRightsReserved`

A new revision Object always has the status _Initializing_ analog to the initial creation of an Object. 
In the same way, the Object must be finished either through a single part data upload or a manual finish request to set its status to _Available_.

??? Abstract "Required permissions"

    This request requires at least WRITE permissions on the Object or one of its parent resources.

### Update which creates a new revision

If a new revision of an Object gets created it basically gets cloned with the specified updates applied.
As already mentioned in the general Object update introduction, the newly created Object must be finished in order for it to have its status set from _Initializing_ to _Available_.

    1. Could also be left `false` since the name change alone triggers the creation of a new revision.

## Delete Object

Objects can also be deleted again according to the FAIR guidelines.

!!! Info

    Deletion does not remove the Object from the database, but sets the status of the Object "DELETED".
    
    This means that deleted objects or individually deleted revisions of objects do not simply disappear, but a _tombstone_ of the deleted resource remains.

<!-- 
**Object deletion rulebook:**

??? Example "Deletion of the last reference of an Object deletes the complete Object."

    ![Visualization what happens if the last reference of an object gets deleted.](../imgs/delete_last_object_reference.png)

??? Example "Deleting a reference of an object while other references still exist only removes the specific reference."

    ![Visualization what happens if some reference of an object gets deleted.](../imgs/delete_some_object_reference.png)

??? Example "If the last existing reference of an Object is `writeable == false` (i.e. read-only) the Object exists without possibility of further modification."

    ![Visualization what happens if the last writeable reference of an object gets deleted.](../imgs/delete_last_writeable_reference.png)

??? Example "With `force == true` an Objects revision can be deleted without regards to other references."

    ![Visualization what happens if an object revision gets forcefully deleted.](../imgs/delete_force_object_reference.png)

??? Example "With `force == true` and `with_revisions == true` an Object can be deleted completely without regards to other references."

    ![Visualization what happens if all object revisions get forcefully deleted.](../imgs/delete_force_revisions_object.png)

!!! Warning "Deletion of Objects from versioned Collections is prohibited without exceptions."
-->

??? Abstract "Required permissions"

    This request requires at least ADMIN permissions on the Object or one of its parent resources.
