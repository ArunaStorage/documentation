The system uses an underlying distributed NewSQL database to manage detailed information about its resources. The database can be deployed across multiple data centers and scaled horizontally to keep pace with the growth of the data stored. Data submitted by users is stored using data proxies, which provide an S3-compatible API with additional functionality to abstract from existing storage infrastructures. This allows a variety of different academic computing and storage providers to be integrated into the system, enabling easy and automated offsite backups and site-local caches, while allowing participants to retain full data sovereignty.</p> <p>All data uploaded and stored by users is stored as an Object, represented as a sequence of bytes without any semantic information. Once uploaded, these Objects are immutable. Updates create new Objects that reference the original Object, resulting in a history of changes. Objects are organized into Project with optional Collections and Datasets. A Dataset consists of closely related Objects and is used to combine data and metadata for easier access and organization. Collections and Projects, on the other hand, contain a set of Objects and Datasets that represent a scoped view of the data. Collections, Datasets and Projects can also be snapshotted, capturing the current state and providing a persistent, versioned identifier. This allows other researchers to accurately reproduce results based on a specific version, while allowing for continuous modification of the current data. All resources and their relationships form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with Projects as roots and Objects as leaves.</p> <p> </p> Schematic overview of centralised and decentralised AOS components. The centralised AOS components handle authentication and authorisation by integrating existing IAM providers in combination with user-specific attributes (ABAC). The central components also provide a registry with meta-descriptions and locality information making records discoverable. The decentralised components consist of data proxy applications that expose existing data structures via a common S3 interface and enable data exchange and caching in a peer to peer network within and between participants. ."},{"location":"#components","title":"Components","text":"<p>Schematic of a hierarchical structure of AOS resources.

For the best accessibility all the examples are written for the freely available tool  s5cmd which is an extremely fast command line client for uploading,  retrieving and managing data in Amazon S3 and other cloud storage service providers that use/support the S3 protocol.</p> <p>DataProxy access</p> <p>Before you can directly communicate with or upload data to a DataProxy you have to \"register\" your user first by requesting credentials for the specific endpoint.</p> <p>This is for data protection reasons, so that each DataProxy only receives and stores the data that is relevant to it.</p> <p>s5cmd Configuration</p> <p>s5cmd makes use of the  standard S3 configuration and credentials file. The examples in this section assume only a minimalist configuration containing the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key and DataProxy host.

to integrate external services to extend functionality.  Once created, they're available globally in the AOS, and Projects must be associated with them to be included in their trigger cycle.  The action that triggers the specific hook is defined by its trigger type.</p> <p>The individual trigger types currently include:</p> <ul> <li>HookAdded: Triggers, when a Hook key-value gets added to a resource. Can be limited to specific values.</li> <li>ResourceCreated: Triggers for all hierarchical resources on creation.</li> <li>LabelAdded: Triggers, when a Label key-value gets added to a resource. Can be limited to specific values.</li> <li>ObjectFinished: Triggers only for Objects on finish.</li> <li>StaticLabelAdded: Triggers, when an immutable Label key-value gets added to a resource. Can be limited to specific values.</li> <li>HookStatusChanged: Triggers, if a hook status change occurs on a resource.</li> </ul> <p>A distinction is made between external hooks and internal hooks, which have slightly different use cases.  External hooks address an external service that can use the transferred information to perform its formatting/validation/processing/... and return a result and/or upload the result data itself.  The transferred information contains the metadata of a resource, which can also contain a link to the uploaded data of an Object in order to make it available to the service. Internal hooks are responsible for the automatic binding of specific labels/hooks on resources and/or the creation of relationships.  In other words, internal hooks can be used to automate certain AOS internal processes.</p> <p>The information sent to the external service can be customized by overwriting with the <code>custom_template</code> parameter. The format of the additional information is absolutely free as long as it contains the mandatory placeholder from the following list:</p> Placeholder Necessity Description {{secret}} mandatory Token secret that contains WRITE permissions on the resource that triggered the Hook. {{object_id}} mandatory Id of the resource that triggered the Hook. {{hook_id}} mandatory Id of the Hook that triggered the external service. {{pubkey_serial}} mandatory Id of the public key that shall be used to verify the token signature. {{name}} optional Name of the resource that triggered the Hook. {{description}} optional Description of the resource that triggered the Hook. {{size}} optional Size in bytes of the resource that triggered the Hook. {{key_values}} optional Key-value pairs of the resource that triggered the Hook. {{status}} optional Status of the resource that triggered the Hook. {{class}} optional Data class of the resource that triggered the Hook. {{endpoints}} optional Endpoints associated with the resource that triggered the Hook. {{download_url}} optional Presigned URL that can used to download the data uploaded to the Object. {{access_key}} optional Access Key Id part of the S3 credentials that can be used to upload data. {{secret_key}} optional Secret Key part of the S3 credentials that can be used to upload data. <p>The default template that gets send if no custom template is defined as JSON:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"hook_id\": \"{{hook_id}}\",\n  \"object\": {\n    \"resource_id\": \"{{object_id}}\",\n    \"persistent_resource_id\": true/false, // (1)\n
